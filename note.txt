                                    - Basic Commands
                        
                        1. To create project - ng new project-name

                        2. To run project - ng serve / ng serve --open

                        3. To generate Components - ng g c Component-name

                        4. To create Service - ng g s service-name

                        5. to create pipe - ng g p pipe-name

                                    - Basic Concepts
            
            1. Module - Import liabraries - Root Module - AppModule

            2. Components - generate html, css, ts - Root Components - AppComponent

            3. To setup path for Component - AppRoutingModule
                 - syntax:{ path:'path name' , component:component-name } inside Routes Array
            
            4. Selectors - replace it with corresponding component html page

            5. router-outlet Selector is used to switch
                  page according to user request in Root component html page

            6. Angular Service - reusable code can be stored , 
                  and we can use it in all component across the application

            7. Dependency Injection - to share data between dependent classes, (in constructor)
                 syntax: access-specifiers variable-name : dependent class name  
                 access-specifiers (public /private) 

            8. Asyncronous Function call - (rxjs libraries) Observable
                   - resolve (subscribe)
                   - reject (catch)

            9. Data Binding - share data within a component
                9.1 One way Binding - share data only in one direction at a time

                  9.1.1 Component(ts) to View(html) file

                           9.1.1.1 String Interpolation - syntax: {{class-property-name}} in html

                           9.1.1.2 property Binding - syntax:[attribute]="class-property-name"

                  9.1.2 view(html) to component(ts) file

                       9.1.2.1  Event Binding - (event-name)="function call()"

                       9.1.2.2  Event Binding using $event - (event-name)="function call($event)"


                9.2 Two way Binding - share data only in two direction at a time

                  9.2.1  ngModel - Import FormsModule , [(ngModel)]="property-name"

                        

            10. Angular Directive - to manipulate DOM

                  10.1 Component Directive
                  10.2 Structural Directive - based on condition or array length we can add/remove html 
                                              elements from DOM
                         10.2.1 *ngIf = "condition" - inside html element
                         10.2.2 *ngFor="let iterator of array-name"
                                                                            
                  10.3 Attribute Directive - based on some value / class property we can set style
                                             of html elements

            11. Activated Route - Provides access to information about a route associated with a component that is 
                                  loaded in an outlet.

            
            12. ngForm - to track the form values

            13. Pipe - Use pipes to transform strings, currency amounts, dates, and other data for display.

            14. BehaviorSubject - used which acts as a single store to hold updated shared data.
